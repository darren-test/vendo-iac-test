# File: ansible/sites/vendo-test-site/inventory
# Inventory file for vendo-test-site environment. The IPs of these hosts are based on "type" tags in EC2 and dynamically assigned by ec2.py when ansible is called.
#
# Map the ec2 groups (from the dynamic inventory ec2.py) to our groups.
# This merges the static and dynamic inventory.
